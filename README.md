# Python-Live Project

# <a id="section1">Introduction</a> 

 During a two week sprint I was part of a team working on a Python Live Project using Django. In this two weeks using Azure DevOps and Agile framework we were given stories to complete and attended daily stand ups. Along with daily stand ups at the end of each week we also had Code retrospective. As part of a team working on a larger project we had to use GIT for version control, pull requests, merge conflicts and resolutions, migration conflicts and resolutions. We were tasked with creating a Web app with CRUD functionality. We had total control of what our Web app could be about and what Front-end styling would work best for our app. Along with CRUD functionality I also added an API to the web app. Below I will show some screenshots of the Front-end and Back-end of my app.

 I created an Baby Activities tracker app with Django framework. I included a navbar to each section of my site and styling using CSS. Here are some screenshots of what I have done.

 - Here is the Home page

 - This is the Create page with a form that saves to a database.

# <a id="section3">Back-end stories and screenshots</a>
Here is some of the Back-end for the Baby Activities tracker app. Included will be the base.html, urls.py, models.py and views.py. Along with creating all the content I also would handle any of the debugging that would come up with team members.

- This is the base.html that all the other pages would use as a template.

- Here is the urls.py code that I use for all the pages of my site.

- This is part 1 of my views.py showing some of the functions I used for my app.

- This is part 2 of my views.py showing some more of the functions I used for my app.

- Finally this is the model I made for my app. This form when filled out gets saved to the database.

# <a id="section4">Final summary</a> 
 This two week sprint really help me learn the skills of working in an software development team. Working together to improve and fix bugs in our code. Using VCS to fix any errors that slip by. Improving work flow with communication skills. The lessons learned here will truly help me to be a better software developer and team member in future projects and employment.
