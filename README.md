# Python-Live Project
 
# Introduction 
 During a two week sprint I was part of a team working on a Python Live Project using Django. In this two weeks using Azure DevOps and Agile framework we were given stories to complete and attended daily stand ups. Along with daily stand ups at the end of each week we also had Code retrospective. As part of a team working on a larger project we had to use GIT for version control, pull requests, merge conflicts and resolutions, migration conflicts and resolutions. We were tasked with creating a Web app with CRUD functionality. We had total control of what our Web app could be about and what Front-end styling would work best for our app. Along with CRUD functionality I also added an API to the web app. Below I will show some screenshots of the Front-end and Back-end of my app.
